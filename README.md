My name is wyatt oyler, I am from Heber City UT. I Began the Studies fo game design and 3d animation in highschool as I took multiple digital media classes.
My senior year I went to Pixar for a school trip and absolutly fell in love with the work place. I realized with my computer craving skills and want to create and make things with computers
I decided to start my schooling with Dixie state web design. Felt too far away from home and decided to come to UVU! Now I plan on continuing my skills in the computer world with the hopes to work my way back to pixar or a game development company.
